# Fiber-Photometry-preprocessing
There files are used for preprocessing for calcium signals from fiber photometry.
In several simple scripts uploaded by us, readers can select the imported code file according to the format of data, and then make linear correction, and get F value after correction. The file Calciumsignal_shade.m is used to draw the error band of calcium signals.
